# Download / Installation guide:
Currently only Mac OSX is supported, if you'd like to see a windows or linux version please let me know and I'll do my best to include those builds in the next versions.
To download and install the tool simply go to the [releases section](https://github.com/3-dots/Machine/releases) and download the latest version for your platform/OS, then after un-zipping the archive you can either double-click on the app to open it or drag and drop in your Applications folder to install it and make it accessible through Spotlight and what not! ;)
After installation you'll have the option to auto-update to the latest version ( if available ) easily

# Privacy:
Machine is ( to my knowledge ) the only app that currently uses the Coinbase latest version of the secure SSO, you enter your credentials on the Coinbase site itself and Machine will never have access to them, in addition, the required permissions are set to the absolute minimum necessary for the functionality of the app, Also you can monitor the activity of the app and deny it access at anytime from within CoinBase website ( settings > Security )

# Screen-shots:
