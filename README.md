# Download / Installation guide:
Currently only Mac OSX is supported, if you'd like to see a windows or linux version please let me know and I'll do my best to include those builds in the next versions.
To download and install the tool simply go to the [releases section](https://github.com/3-dots/Machine/releases) and download the latest version for your platform/OS, then after un-zipping the archive you can either double-click on the app to open it or drag and drop in your Applications folder to install it and make it accessible through Spotlight and what not! ;)
